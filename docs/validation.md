# Validation and provenance

## Original hardware work

The release extraction comes from the original `kernel-mod` project at commit
`87b88039a5786f6669c3deef81cda723720cea8c` (2026-08-15). The kernel control
driver, Python controller, systemd files, and eight original tests were copied
without behavior changes. The public build/signing scripts and documentation
were adapted for standalone use. Exploratory modules, private operational
notes, signing material, and firmware binaries are not part of this repository.

The original notes record these results on two NVIDIA DGX Sparks, board P4242,
DGX OS 7.5.0, kernel `6.17.0-1029-nvidia`, EC 3.5.8, SoC firmware 2.155.11,
with Secure Boot enabled:

| Exercise | Recorded observation |
| --- | --- |
| Read-only RPM observer | 120 samples over two minutes on one system; stable 2700/4050 RPM |
| Bounded 4500 RPM floor | Approximately 4500/4455 RPM; independent unset-clamp readback after rollback |
| Bounded 13500 RPM floor | Channel maxima 9000/13500 RPM reached within 6.3 seconds |
| Control driver state sequence | 0 → 3 → 8 → 12 → 0, with readback and automatic restoration |
| Python curve on hot sensors | 0 → 2 → 4 → 6 → 8 → 10 → 12 at two-second intervals |
| Python termination | SIGTERM restored state 0 |
| Persistent installation | Both systems built/signed locally and started the systemd service |
| Service lifecycle | Stop/start on one installed system restored automatic control, then resumed the curve |

Earlier firmware versions were examined offline only. The recorded thermal
experiments are observations, not a controlled performance benchmark. Long-term
reliability and compatibility with later kernels/firmware remain unqualified.

## Checks for the public extraction

`./scripts/check` exercises userspace behavior using temporary files and mock
boundaries, checks the narrow kernel source contract, and parses the shell
scripts. It does not issue FF-A messages or require root. The source assertions
are regression guardrails, not proof of kernel or firmware correctness.

Target compilation must use a Spark's exact NVIDIA kernel headers with `W=1`.
Building is separate from signing, installation, module loading, and live
thermal testing. GitHub Actions runs the hardware-free checks only.

On **2026-09-06**, the public extraction passed all **13 tests** and shell
syntax checks. Signing-key generation, file permissions, and refusal to
overwrite an existing key pair passed an isolated temporary-directory check.
The Python runtime source matched the original byte for byte; the kernel source differed only in author metadata.

The extracted module also compiled on a Spark against
`6.17.0-1029-nvidia` with `W=1` and the expected aarch64 vermagic. Kbuild noted
the compiler command-name difference (`gcc-13` versus
`aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc-13`, both Ubuntu GCC 13.3.0) and skipped BTF generation
because `vmlinux` was unavailable. There were no driver compilation errors.
This check used a temporary build directory and did not sign, install, or load
the module, or modify the running controller. The public signing wrapper has
not been exercised end to end with an enrolled key.

## Installation-guide and DKMS checks

On **2026-09-06**, the added `dkms.conf` passed an isolated **DKMS 3.0.11
add/build** on a Spark with `6.17.0-1029-nvidia`. DKMS reported the module as
`built`; `modinfo` confirmed version 0.1.0, the target aarch64 vermagic, and
the test certificate's signing identity. This used an upstream DKMS script,
temporary source/state directories, and a disposable signing key. The test
did not register with the host's system DKMS tree, enroll a key, install or
load a module, or change the running controller. Temporary files were removed.

All 13 existing tests and shell syntax checks passed. Documentation links and
anchors were checked, and all 38 documented shell blocks passed `bash -n`.
The Bash job example was exercised with mock commands for job success, job
failure, and restoration failure; it attempted automatic restoration and
returned the expected exit status in each case. This does not verify real
signal delivery, sudo renewal, or EC recovery on hardware.

System-wide DKMS installation, distribution kernel-update hooks, and preboot
enrollment remain operator steps described in the guide, not actions performed
by these checks.

## Known limitations

- This is an out-of-tree kernel module tied to the observed platform and APIs.
  DKMS can rebuild it for new kernels, but there is no promise of compatibility
  with a changed kernel or firmware contract.
- Manual floors do not expire. SIGKILL, a kernel crash, or a broken transport
  can prevent restoration. A retained lower floor can leave the fans running
  faster; it does not suppress firmware cooling demand.
- Restoration refuses a floor that does not match the driver's last confirmed
  state. A write that reaches the EC but loses its acknowledgement can therefore
  leave an unconfirmed floor and require operator recovery.
- The kernel resets its state on suspend. The daemon caches its last state and
  does not resynchronize it on resume or after an external writer changes it.
  Restart the service after resume; use only one policy writer. NVIDIA automatic
  policy continues to operate while the added floor is unset.
- The daemon ignores individual unreadable or implausible thermal sensors.
  Maximum cooling is requested only when no valid sensor readings remain.
- Fan RPM is not an exact setpoint. Firmware demand, fan saturation, and ramp
  time affect observed values. State 0 removes this driver's floor; it does not
  force an immediate return to idle RPM.
- Some investigated boots had an unavailable secure eSPI transport. See the
  [troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md) before attempting recovery.
